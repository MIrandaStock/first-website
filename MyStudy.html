                                    The average score for all my courses is 89.32, and the average achievement point is 3.74,

                            <p>On the right is a website which I have done in a course design,it is an online bookstore, 
                                and the picture is the entrance for this site. The biggest highlight of this online bookstore is
                                that the recycling of second-hand books can be done online. 
                                The back-end of this site uses the JFinal framework, and the jQuery framework is used on 
                                the front-end. If you want to know more, click on the picture on the right!</p>

                <p>When it comes to social work, I joined the student union when l was a freshman 
                    and became the minister of my department a year later. 
                    I joined the College volleyball team when I was a sophomore and 
                    served as Commissary in charge of publicity in my class. 
                    Now, l served as Commissary in charge of general affairs in the class 
                    and I've always been the dorm monitor. </p>
